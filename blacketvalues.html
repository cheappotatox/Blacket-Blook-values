        <h2><strong>Definitions</strong></h2>
        <div class="text"><strong>Copies:</strong> How much of that blook exists in total. This includes copies from users with a duplicate (more than one of that blook), banned users, inactive users (users who haven't been online for over a week), and bazaar listings.</div>
        <div class="text"><strong>Sell Price:</strong> How much you can sell the blook for on default.</div>
        <div class="text"><strong>Value:</strong> How much it is currently worth in tokens. This might not always be reliable, which is why we have Glicko.</div>
        <div class="text"><strong>O/C:</strong> This means that the blook does not have a defined value, and it is up to the owner of that blook to decide how much the blook is worth. This usually applies to seasonal blooks, or contests blooks. The reason is that these blooks completely destroy the generalization of our formula.</div>
        <div class="text"><strong>None:</strong> This is applied in "Pack". This means that the blook cannot be obtained by opening packs.</div>
        <div class="text"><strong>Unobtainable:</strong> This is applied in "Drop Rate." This means that the blook cannot be currently obtained by simply opening packs.</div>
        <div class="text"><strong>NaN:</strong> This is applied in "Glicko." This means that one of the variables for calculating the Glicko is not given, resulting in an output that is not a number.</div>
        <div class="text"><strong>Pack:</strong> What pack the blook is in.</div>
        <div class="text"><strong>Rarity:</strong> A label describing how hard it is to obtain such blook. The hardest is Iridescent, followed by Mystical, Chroma, then Legendary.</div>
        <div class="text"><strong>Drop rate:</strong> The chances of getting the blook.</div>
        <div class="text"><strong>Glicko:</strong> Describes how confident the number of the value of the blook is. The lower the Glicko, the more confident. (For more context, a Glicko of under 50.00 is considered "high confidence", anything above 100.00 is considered "low confidence")</div>
        <div class="text"><strong>Demand:</strong> Represents how many people requests for the blook. Since we do not know the time period or demand size, we could only estimate the category it is in.</div>
        <div class="text"><strong>* Note: This calculator is not linked to the Blacket Bot in any way. Any data may be inaccurate, but the incertitude should usually be â‰¤ 10% *</strong></div>
