        <h3><strong>Context:</strong></h3>
        <div class="text"><strong>Definitions:</strong></div>
        <div class="text"><strong>Copies:</strong> How much of that blook exists in total. This includes copies from users with a duplicate, banned users, inactive users, and bazaar listings.</div>
        <div class="text"><strong>Sell Price:</strong> How much you can sell the blook for on default.</div>
        <div class="text"><strong>Value:</strong> How much it is worth in tokens. This might not always be reliable, which is why we have Glicko.</div>
        <div class="text"><strong>O/C:</strong> This means that the blook does not have a defined value, and it is up to the owner of that blook to decide how much the blook is worth. This usually applies to seasonal blooks, or contests blooks. The reason is that these blooks completely destroy the generalization of our formula.</div>
        <div class="text"><strong>Pack:</strong> What pack the blook is in.</div>
        <div class="text"><strong>Rarity:</strong> A label describing how hard it is to obtain such blook. The hardest is Iridescent, followed by Mystical, Chroma, then Legendary.</div>
        <div class="text"><strong>Drop rate:</strong> The chances of getting the blook.</div>
        <div class="text"><strong>Glicko:</strong> Describes how accurate the value of the blook is. The lower the Glicko, the more accurate. (For more context, a Glicko of under 10.00 is pretty accurate, anything above 30.00 is considered unaccurate)</div>
